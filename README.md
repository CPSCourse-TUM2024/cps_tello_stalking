# CPS Project: Stalking System

This project involves the development of a computer vision system for tracking and following the object based on its color using Tello drone. The system uses OpenCV for processing the images from the Telloâ€™s video stream and djitellopy library for controlling the movements of the drone. The goal of the project is to create a simple vision system that effectively tracks the given object.
